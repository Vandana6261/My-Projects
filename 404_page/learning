in button we dont uses text-align because button is not for text. we should onlu use text-align on text contain tag.
we dont use div here because it is a block level element and it takes whole width and when we will give them color it looks bad.
Use line height when you have a paragraph or multiline content, otherwise use margin to decrease or increase the space between 2 element.
all animation and complex graphics we see on webpages are not code, some of them are videos.
